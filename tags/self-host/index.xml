      <description>What is yt-local and Why would you want to install it? yt-local is a browser-based client written in Python for watching YouTube anonymously and without the lag of the slow page used by YouTube. One of the primary features is that all requests are routed through Tor, except for the video file at googlevideo.com. Tor has high latency, so this will not be as fast network-wise as regular YouTube. However, using Tor is optional; when not routing through Tor, video pages may load faster than they do with YouTube&amp;rsquo;s page depending on your browser.</description>
